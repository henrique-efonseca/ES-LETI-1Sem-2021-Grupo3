## SCRUM DASHBOARD

The idea of this project is to develop a Java Desktop application that allows extracting, calculating and displaying metrics for monitoring and evaluating the progress of software projects that follow the SCRUM approach.
The application obtains the project data from the Trello and Github platforms, for which the user must indicate the project identification on these platforms. 

This project was developed in Java and we mainly used two APIs: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/ and https://docs.github.com/pt/rest.

We implemented all the features that were asked on the project assignment.
